  <p>This presidential election was one of the most controversial and devisive in recent history. The youngest voters, or the Millennial Generation, tended to stick to Hillary Clinton,
  unsurprisingly leaning toward the Democratic candidate. One of the more fascinating revelations, though, was the 18-29-year-olds' fondness of third party candidates.
  This trend, though strangely popular in the summer into September, seemed to give way to major party candidates by the time Election Day actually came around on November 8.
